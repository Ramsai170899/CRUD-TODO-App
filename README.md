## ✨ List/Dictionary Manager – A Beautiful Browser-Based CRUD App

Welcome to the **List/Dict Manager**, a sleek, browser-based CRUD application built with **Flask**, **HTML/CSS**, and a sprinkle of fun design magic! 🪄

This app lets users create, edit, and manage multiple **named lists** and **dictionaries** – all stored persistently using a simple **JSON file** on the backend. No databases. No complications. Just lightweight and elegant data management.

### 🌟 Features

✅ **Create Named Lists & Dictionaries**  
– Users can create as many named lists or dictionaries as they like.  
– All data is stored in a persistent `data.json` file.

✅ **Beautiful Inline Editing**  
– Rename items or update values with a smooth inline editing interface.  
– Pencil ✏️ icons open edit mode directly within the table – no popup mess!

✅ **Move Items Up & Down**  
– Rearranging items in both lists and dictionaries is a breeze using 🔼 and 🔽 buttons.

✅ **Stylish UI**  
– Clean layout with tables for systematic display.  
– Colorful emoji icons for actions (🗑️ delete, ✏️ edit, etc.)  
– Playful and friendly vibe using **Comic Sans MS** and pastel themes 🎨

✅ **CRUD Everything**  
– Add, edit, delete, reorder – all operations available for both lists and dictionaries.

✅ **Persistent Storage**  
– All changes are automatically saved to a local JSON file so your data lives on, even after a refresh.
